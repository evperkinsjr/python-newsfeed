# Python Newsfeed
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
For this project, I used Python and Flask to refactor the back end of a news application originally built with Node and Handlebars. Just Tech News, lets users post links to tech-related articles, comment on other users' posts, and upvote posts.

The application was deployed using Heroku.
